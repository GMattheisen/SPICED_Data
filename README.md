## Artifical Neural Network with Backpropogation

In this [file](ANN_implementation_w_backpropagation.py) and this [file](neural_network.py), I construct a neural network from scratch with backpropogation.

## Baby Name Time Series

In this [file](Baby_name_time_series.py), I look at the time series data of baby name popularity. Data looks at baby name popularity over time divided by gender and the number of distinct names over time as categorized by gender. I then use linear regression and polynomial regression to predict the popularity of specific names over time.

This project uses baby name data supplied by the U.S. Social Security Administration that can be found [here](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html).

## Convoluted Neural Network for Image Recognition

In this [file](Convoluted_NN_Image_Recognition.py), I build a neural network to classify elements within images.

## Movie Recommender Using Cosine Similarity

In this [file](Cosine_Similarites_PCA.py), I build a movie recommender that utilizes cosine similarity.

## Predicting Cryptocurrency Values

In this [file](Cryptocurrency_predictions_prophet.ipynb), I extract cryptocurrency values using the Coingecko API and look at time series data. I then predict future values using a number of machine learning methods, including linear regression, polynomial regression with Ridge and Lasso regularization, and Prophet.

## Neural Network for Image Classification with MNIST Data

In this [file](MNISTData.py), I build a neural network to classify the MNIST data set of handwritten figures.

## Movie Recommender Using Non-Matrix Factorization

In this [file](Movie_Recommender_Using_NMF.py), I build a movie recommender that utilizes non-matrix factorization.

## Pillow Tutorial

In this [file](Pillow_Tutorial.ipynb), I give a tutorial for the uses of the Python Library Pillow and build a GIF.

## Predicting Baby Name Popularity Over Time

## Predicting Survival on the Titanic

In this [file](Predicting_Survival_Titanic.ipynb), I use information given for the passengers of the Titanic to analyze the best predictors of survival. This submission received of score of 77.99% on Kaggle.
